# BlockGame
Simple block game made using Eclipse Window Builder and Java Swing.


Idea: move the black block with WASD, avoid the white block and try reach to the blue area. After each turn terrain changes.


Game is at the playable stage right now, but one annoying bug still remains unsolved. Enemy will get stuck in certain formations terrain blocks.
